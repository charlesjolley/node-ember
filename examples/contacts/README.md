Example using Ember for Node with Convoy to generate a client-side app.
To try this out just do the following:

  1.  `npm install` inside this directory.
  2.  `node server.js` to start the connect server.
  3.  Visit http://localhost:3000/index.html

This code just require ember and convoy does the rest.
